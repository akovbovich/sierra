This chart can be one of the same symbols in the group. However, it needs to be a separate chart.  This chart needs to have the Include Columns With No Data option on. The other charts should not. This chart needs to use a short time period per bar such as 10 seconds.  A 10 second period would analyze the direction over a period of 10 seconds.  Set the List of Chart Numbers input to a comma separated list of all the charts you want to create a tick index from. All the charts that the study refers to will automatically be set to the same time period as the chart it is applied to. A longer duration tick index consisting of bars can be created by referencing this study using the Study Overlay OHLC study on a longer duration chart.  For efficiency, the chart that this study is applied to, and the charts which the study creates a tick index from, all should have the Days To Load setting set to a small number like 1. When the charts are  opened and after data downloading from the data service, then to ensure the custom tick study has referenced all the data in all the charts it refers to, select Chart >> Reload on the menu to perform a full recalculation.";
